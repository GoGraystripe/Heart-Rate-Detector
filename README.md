# Heart-Rate-Detector
Built a finger-mounted heart rate monitor using a photodiode, op amp, and analog circuit components.  Implemented real-time signal smoothing with an exponential moving average and threshold-based peak detection in Arduino to calculate BPM. Displayed heart rate via serial monitor.
